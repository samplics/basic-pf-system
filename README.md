# basic-pf-system
Basic Provably fair system for custom roulette game roughly based off of csgo empire's

generates numbers for a dice-like roulette game where you bet on a range of numbers

just uses sha256 hashes, so you could easily get different number formats from the hashes

uses mongodb to store all information, im not super good with databases lol
